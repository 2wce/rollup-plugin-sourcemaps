# rollup-plugin-sourcemaps

[Rollup](https://http://rollupjs.org) plugin for grabbing source maps from sourceMappingURLs.

Useful for working with precompiled modules with existing source maps, without resorting to [sorcery](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/sorcery).

Inspired by [webpack/source-map-loader](https://github.com/webpack/source-map-loader).
